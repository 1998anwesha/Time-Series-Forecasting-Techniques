# Time-Series-Forecasting-Techniques

Compared machine learning methods for forecasting the interior temperature of a solar-powered home, and compared their mean squared errors. 

Methods used: 
1) linear regression with all-weather features,
2) linear regression with lag features,
3) tree based estimator XGboost
4) Hybrid linear tree regressor 

Hybrid linear tree regressor - here we tried to explore a method that combines the effectiveness of non-parametric tree-based estimators with the extrapolative capabilities of linear regression. 
Please refer to this [report](https://github.com/1998anwesha/Time-Series-Forecasting-Techniques/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20Techniques.pdf) for a detailed analysis of each method, their drawbacks, results obtained, graphical representations and MSE values.
